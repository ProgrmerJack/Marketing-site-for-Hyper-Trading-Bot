      title: "The Problem I Witnessed",
      content: "After years building risk and execution systems across traditional finance and digital assets, I saw the same pattern repeat: platforms making bold performance claims without verifiable proof, systems failing when markets turned volatile, and retail investors bearing the consequences of inadequate risk controls.",
    },
    {
      title: "Why I Built This",
      content: "Inflation erodes purchasing power at 3-5% annually in stable economies, and much more in volatile periods. Meanwhile, traditional fund managers charge 2% management fees plus 20% performance fees while providing quarterly reports with no real-time transparency. I believed there had to be a better way—automation that works for investors, not against them.",
    },
    {
      title: "The Technical Philosophy",
      content: "Every design decision prioritizes verifiability over velocity. Our 120+ component architecture processes market signals in under 120ms, but speed means nothing without accuracy. Every trade goes through multi-layered risk checks. Every decision is logged. Every claim is backed by signed data you can verify independently.",
    },
    {
      title: "Building for Oversight, Not Avoiding It",
      content: "Most crypto platforms operate in gray areas, avoiding regulation. We're doing the opposite—actively engaging with government agencies, preparing for independent audits, and building systems designed to meet institutional oversight standards. It's harder and slower, but it's the only way to build something that lasts.",
